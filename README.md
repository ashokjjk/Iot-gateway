# Iot-gateway

Edge computing provides a layer of security and reduce computational latency between sensor nodes and remote datacenter.
It also serve as a gateway. In this IoT world there is Bigdata problem due to 1000's of data points are generated by the sensors which are less likely useful. But at the same time they cannot be discarded therefore, an effective approach has to be taken at the edge layer to transfer useful insights to remote datacenter for further processing.
This project has the ability to collect the data from the sensor using MQTT broker from sensor emulator and process the data with respect to lightweight processing such as Filtering & Aggregation and transfer the data in a tumbling window timeline.
